<body>
    <p>
        was born in an empty sea, My tears created oceans
        Producing tsunami waves with emotions
        Patrolling the open seas of an unknown galaxy
        I was floating in front of who I am physically
        Spiritually paralyzing mind body and soul
        It gives me energy when I'm lyrically exercising
