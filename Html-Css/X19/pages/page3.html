                        In descriptive writing, the author does not just tell the reader what was seen, felt, tested,
                        smelled, or heard. Rather, the author describes something from their own experience and, through
                        careful choice of words and phrasing, makes it seem real. Descriptive writing is vivid,
                        colorful, and detailed.

                        was born in an empty sea, My tears created oceans
                        Producing tsunami waves with emotions
                        Patrolling the open seas of an unknown galaxy
                        I was floating in front of who I am physically
                        Spiritually paralyzing mind body and soul
                        It gives me energy when I'm lyrically exercising
                        I gotta spit 'til the story is told in a dream by celestial bodies
                        Follow me baby

                        To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit
                        the reader's knowledge and attention span. "Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the
                        armrests of the Tipu Sultan's golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest
                        executioners" will have the reader checking their phone halfway through. "Her eyes were
                        sapphires, bright and hard" creates the same effect in a fraction of the reading time. As always
                        in the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.

                        It was a cold grey day in late November. The weather had changed overnight, when a backing wind
                        brought a granite sky and a mizzling rain with it, and although it was now only a little after
                        two o'clock in the afternoon the pallor of a winter evening seemed to have closed upon the
                        hills, cloaking them in mist.
