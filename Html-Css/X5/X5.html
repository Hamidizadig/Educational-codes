        <b>Between</b> 1838 and 1851, <strong>natural philosopher</strong> Richard Laming developed the idea that an
        atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit
        <i>electric</i> <em>charges[1] Beginning</em> in 1846, German physicist William Weber theorized that electricity
        was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was
        <u>governed</u> by <ns>the <b>inverse</b> square</ins> law. After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in
        1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney sugges[2] However, Stoney believed these charges were permanently
        attached to <mark> and could not be removed. In 1881</mark>, German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz argued that
        both positive and negative charges were divided into
        elementary parts, each of which behaves like atoms of electricity.[3]

        each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a
        pair of interacting "electrons must be able to" swap positions without an observable change to the state of the
        system. The wave function of
        fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped;
        that is,
        q(r1, r2) = −q(r2, r1), where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons,
        respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this
        <blockquote><strong>corresponds to equal probabilities.</strong> </blockquote>Bosons, such as the photon, have
        symmetric wave functions instead.[3]:162–218
